					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						Yoga is about 5000 years old and one of the ancient and proven forms of exercise for gaining
						fitness.
						It is the most used complementary health approach in the US. The yoga industry is projected to
						reach $215 billion by 2025. There is a lack of on-demand access to quality feedback while
						performing yoga.
					</p>
					<p>We partnered with a smart yoga mat manufacturer, <a href="https://yogifi.fit/">YogiFi</a>, that
						uses the heatmap from the pressure-sensitive, smart yoga mats to classify yoga poses and provide
						recommendations to its customers. However, due to heatmap signatures being the same for some
						yoga poses, with difference being only in the upper body postures, YogiFi had challenges
						classifying
						them.

					<h2>Features</h2>
					<div>
						To address the challenges faced by YogiFi, we developed SensAI. Some of the highlights of our
						solution are:
						<ul>
							<li>
								An AI powered web application that addresses significant pain point in yoga by providing
								accurate feedback on alignment and posture.
							</li>
							<li>
								It offers a non-intrusive solution that respects user privacy.
							</li>
							<li>
								It leverages latest advancements in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and the best
								practices of Software Engineering to provide a low-cost serverless architecture hosted
								on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
							</li>
							<li>Our solution has the potential to be applied to other fitness domains.</li>

					<h2>How it works</h2>
					<p>SensAI leverages state-of-the-art Machine Learning solutions and Software Engineering best
						practices to
						provide a low-cost, serverless yoga assistant hosted on AWS. The application is set up using Infrastructure as Code to
						quickly bring up all of the application infrastructure and optimize developer efficiency. The
						front-end is a React app hosted on AWS Amplify, We use Amazon cognito for managing users and AWS
						Sagemaker serverless inference endpoint backed by API gateway, to host our model and to make
						inference. </p>

					<h2>Datasets</h2>
					<p>Our primary dataset is the heatmap data collected from the pressure-sensitive smart yoga mats
						from YogiFi. This dataset contained 13,571 unique heatmaps for 58 yoga poses.</p>
					<p>We create a secondary dataset using yoga pose images obtained from <a
							href="https://sites.google.com/view/yoga-82/home">Yoga-82</a> and yoga pose images shared by
						YogiFi. Using TensorFlow's <a
							href="https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/movenet">Movenet</a> model, we extract 17
						keypoints for 952 yoga pose images corresponding to 9 yoga poses.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="views column-ct" id="modeling">
					<h2>Modeling</h2>
					<p>
						We evaluate four different approaches to yoga classification. The first two are uni-modal models
						where we try classifying using the heatmap from the smart mats, provided by YogiFi, and the
						keypoints that we extracted from the yoga pose images of Yoga-82 and yoga pose images from
						YogiFi, using TensorFlow's Movenet model. The other two are multi-modal models which use early
						fusion and late fusion techniques.
					</p>
					<p>Each heatmap has 1320 values, which can be represented as a 60x22 image. These images are used to
						fine-tune a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 convoluted neural network (CNN). We apply various
						pre-processing transformations such as denoising, extracting contours and centering.</p>

					<p>We train a custom neural network using 17 keypoints extracted using Tensorflow's Movement model
						from yoga poses curated from Yoga-82 and YogiFi's yoga pose images. The keypoints are centered
						and normalized before being fed into the neural net model.</p>

					<p>In the early fusion model, we augment the heatmap data with the keypoints data and transform it
						into an image where the last three rows contain the encoded keypoints data.</p>
					<img src="assets/model/early-fusion.png" alt="early fusion" height="400" width="800"
						style="align-self: center;" />

					<p>In late fusion, we run the two uni-modal trained independently on the two modalities i.e.
						heatmaps and kepypoints and then combine the outputs from the last layers and feed it into a
						classfier.</p>

				<section class="views column-ct" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The heatmap model has <strong>94%</strong> accuracy and is able to decluster most of
						the yoga poses. However, the model performs poorly on 3 clustered poses. mainly because the heat
						maps are identical and the yoga asana difference lies only in the upper body posture.
					</p>
					<p>The keypoints model has <strong>95%</strong> accuracy, implying that keypoints are able to
						decluster most of the poses. However, the model performs poorly on postures that are only
						different in the hand gestures and facial orientation since the Movenet model we use to extract
						keypoints does not capture them. We see that with the keypoints model is
						still not able to decluster all of the poses.</p> <img
						src="assets/model/keypoints-confusion.png" alt="keypoints confusion matrix" height="400"
						width="400" style="align-self: center;" />

					<p>The results from the early-fusion validates our hypothesis that we can use multimodal model to
						decluster the
						yoga poses that we were not able to with just the heatmap. However, we still see from the
						confusion
						matrix, while it improves upon the uni-modal model, the model has some trouble classifying these
						clustered poses.
					</p>
					<img src="assets/model/early-fusion-confusion.png" alt="early fusion confusion matrix" height="400"
						width="400" style="align-self: center;" />
					<p>The late-fusion model was to achieve high training and validation accuracy of nearly 100%.
						The confusion matrix shows that it is able to classify almost all of the poses with only a
						fraction
						of poses being falsely predicted.
